# CV Generation Prompt
Create an improved version of you resume from [../../resume.md](../../resume.md). Show the user identified profile/job after reading these offers. This will create 2 different types of resume:

## Short CV
Don't generate this just for now!
### Rules


## Detailed CV


### Rules
- Prioritize truthfulness and clarity in all content.
- Include as much detail as possible about your professional history, side projects, and education.
- List all jobs, roles, and relevant experiences in reverse-chronological order, regardless of perceived relevance or recency.
- For each position, include company name, dates, job title, and key achievements. Quantify impact with numbers, percentages, and metrics where possible.
- Include all technical and soft skills, certifications, and licenses.
- Start with your name and contact information (professional email, phone number, LinkedIn/GitHub links). Name should be prominent (max 14pt font). Mailing address is optional.
- Optionally include a resume summary or objective statement after contact info. Use active language to describe experience, skills, and accomplishments.
- Add an education section: institution name, dates, degree/area of study. Include relevant coursework, GPA (if >3.5), clubs, leadership, awards, certifications.
- Keep layout clean, readable, and modern. Use bullet points, bold headings, and plenty of white space.
- Never use progress bars, skill ratings, or years of experience. Do not rate yourself as expert or beginner, or use terms like "expert", "beginner", or similar self-assessments.
- When referencing years of experience, always calculate from the date of your first relevant role (do not count or estimate years; use the actual start date for accuracy).
- Ensure all jobs, roles, and relevant experiences from resume.md are included in the detailed CV, unless explicitly excluded by user instruction.
- Work history must match LinkedIn profile.
- Always proofread for typos and grammar.

## Global Rules
- Always analyze and learn from the job descriptions in the [../../docs/job-offers](../../docs/job-offers) folder (don't read info.md). Specialize each CV (short or detailed) for the relevant roles described there. After reading the offers show to the user something like "Preparing CVs for a software developer".
- Don't add any extra info at the end of the CVs not related to the content of the CVs (e.g. "Generated by CVAI", "Preferred PDF format", etc.).
- Create the 2 files in .md format: `short-CV.md` and `detailed-CV.md`. Do not create PDF files, just markdown.
- In [../../docs/not-interested](../../docs/not-interested) folder (don't read info.md) there are files describing what the user does NOT want in their next role. Use this information to minimize or exclude unwanted skills, technologies, industries, or tasks from the CVs. If the user has experience in a skill, technology, industry, or task, it must still be included in the CVs, even if it is listed as not of interest for future roles. Do not omit or hide past experience; only minimize its emphasis and avoid suggesting interest in similar future roles. **Never state or imply that the user is open to, interested in, or seeking roles, skills, or industries listed in docs/not-interested. Only emphasize openness to roles and skills not excluded by the user.**
- If there are no certifications or awards to list (or anything else not listed in resume.md), do not add a placeholder section or make up any information. Only include this section if there are real, verifiable items to show.
- Never include statements in the CV about what the user is NOT seeking (e.g., "Not seeking backend/full-stack or hybrid/on-site positions") or meta-comments about minimizing or emphasizing experience (e.g., "minimized emphasis on backend"). Only include positive, relevant information about the user's experience, skills, and interests.
- Always create the CV file without asking more questions. Do not prompt the user for confirmation before generating the CV
- After generating the CVs, update the website in [../../web-cv/src](../../web-cv/src) replace all the content with the content of the generated detailed CV. Do not ask for confirmation before updating the website.
