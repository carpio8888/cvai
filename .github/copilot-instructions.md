# CRITICAL RULE: Copilot and all AI agents must ALWAYS check this file and the main README for any rules, instructions, or workflows before acting. These files are the canonical source of truth for all automation and agent behavior.


# Global CV/Resume Rules for Software Developers

## Purpose
Guide LLMs and agents to act as personal HR experts for writing and improving CVs/resumes for software developers.

## Automation Safety: No Pushes or PRs Without Explicit Approval

- **CRITICAL:** Do not push commits, create branches, open pull requests, or merge changes in this repository unless explicitly instructed to do so by the repository owner or a designated maintainer. Any automated change must be proposed as a patch or draft for review first.
- **When to act:** You may edit files locally, prepare patches, suggest changes in comments, or create branch/commit instructions, but you must not perform any remote git operations (push, PR, merge, delete branches) until you receive explicit permission.

This rule overrides any other automation preferences in this repository.
