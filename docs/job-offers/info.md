# Job Offers Directory
Add each job offer you are interested in as a separate Markdown (.md) file in this folder. The filename does not matter.

## Purpose
- These files help AI understand the types of roles, skills, and requirements you are targeting.
- The AI uses this information to tailor your resume and optimize it for relevant job applications.
- The more offers you include, the better the AI can match your resume to what companies and HR teams are seeking.

## Instructions
1. For each job offer, create a new .md file in this folder.
2. Paste the full job description, requirements, and any relevant details into the file.
3. Use [https://vasilkoff.com/rich-text2md](https://vasilkoff.com/rich-text2md) to convert job descriptions to Markdown if needed.

## Tip
Include offers from different companies and roles to help the AI build a broader understanding of your interests and the market.
