# Not Interested Directory
This folder is for listing any skills, technologies, job types, or responsibilities you do NOT want in your next role. The purpose is to help AI agents understand your preferences and avoid highlighting unwanted experience in your resume.

## Purpose
- Guide AI to minimize or exclude unwanted skills, technologies, industries, or tasks from your CV.
- Ensure your resume reflects your current interests and career direction.

## Instructions
1. For each area you want to avoid, create a new Markdown (.md) file in this folder. The filename can be anything.
2. Clearly describe what you do not want (e.g., specific languages, frameworks, industries, job duties, work environments).
3. Use bullet points or paragraphs—just make your preferences explicit and easy to parse.
4. If you have job offers you like but there are parts you dislike, mention those here as well.

## Example
- You have 10 years of JavaScript experience but now prefer Java. Add a file describing your wish to avoid JavaScript roles.
- You are not interested in management positions, so add a file explaining this.
- You dislike remote-only jobs, so specify that here.

## Tip
The AI will use this information to shape your resume, referencing unwanted experience only as much as needed and focusing on your preferred direction.
